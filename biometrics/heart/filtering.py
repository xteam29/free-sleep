def hampel_filter(data, filtsize=6):
    '''Detect outliers based on hampel filter

    Funcion that detects outliers based on a hampel filter.
    The filter takes datapoint and six surrounding samples.
    Detect outliers based on being more than 3std from window mean.
    See:
    https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/hampel.html

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 1d list or array
        list or array containing the data to be filtered

    filtsize : int
        the filter size expressed the number of datapoints
        taken surrounding the analysed datapoint. a filtsize
        of 6 means three datapoints on each side are taken.
        total filtersize is thus filtsize + 1 (datapoint evaluated)

    Returns
    -------

def hampel_correcter(data, sample_rate):

    Function that returns te difference between data and 1-second
    windowed hampel median filter. Results in strong noise suppression
    characteristics, but relatively expensive to compute.

    Result on output measures is present but generally not large. However,
    use sparingly, and only when other means have been exhausted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 1d numpy array
        array containing the data to be filtered

    sample_rate : int or float
        sample rate with which data was recorded

def quotient_filter(RR_list, RR_list_mask=[], iterations=2):
    '''applies a quotient filter

    Function that applies a quotient filter as described in
    "Piskorki, J., Guzik, P. (2005), Filtering Poincare plots"

    Parameters
    ----------
    RR_list - 1d array or list
        array or list of peak-peak intervals to be filtered

    RR_list_mask - 1d array or list
        array or list containing the mask for which intervals are
        rejected. If not supplied, it will be generated. Mask is
        zero for accepted intervals, one for rejected intervals.

    iterations - int
        how many times to apply the quotient filter. Multipled
        iterations have a stronger filtering effect
        default : 2

    Returns
    -------
    RR_list_mask : 1d array
        mask for RR_list, 1 where intervals are rejected, 0 where
        intervals are accepted.

    Examples
    --------
    Given some example data let's generate an RR-list first
    >>> import heartpy as hp
    >>> data, timer = hp.load_exampledata(1)
    >>> sample_rate = hp.get_samplerate_mstimer(timer)
    >>> wd, m = hp.process(data, sample_rate)
    >>> rr = wd['RR_list']
    >>> rr_mask = wd['RR_masklist']

    Given this data we can use this function to further clean the data:
    >>> new_mask = quotient_filter(rr, rr_mask)

    Although specifying the mask is optional, as you may not always have a
    pre-computed mask available:
    >>> new_mask = quotient_filter(rr)

    for iteration in range(iterations):
        for i in range(len(RR_list) - 1):
            if RR_list_mask[i] + RR_list_mask[i + 1] != 0:

    data : 1d array or list
        array or list containing the data to be filtered

    sample_rate : int or float
        the sample rate with which data is sampled

    window_length : int or None
        window length parameter for savitzky-golay filter, see Scipy.signal.savgol_filter docs.
        Must be odd, if an even int is given, one will be added to make it uneven.
        default : 0.1  * sample_rate

    polyorder : int
        the order of the polynomial fitted to the signal. See scipy.signal.savgol_filter docs.
        default : 3

    Returns
    -------
    smoothed : 1d array
        array containing the smoothed data

    Examples
    --------
    Given a fictional signal, a smoothed signal can be obtained by smooth_signal():

    >>> x = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 5, 3, 1, 1]
    >>> smoothed = smooth_signal(x, sample_rate = 2, window_length=4, polyorder=2)
    >>> np.around(smoothed[0:4], 3)
    array([1.114, 2.743, 4.086, 5.   ])

    If you don't specify the window_length, it is computed to be 10% of the
    sample rate (+1 if needed to make odd)
    >>> import heartpy as hp
    >>> data, timer = hp.load_exampledata(0)
    >>> smoothed = smooth_signal(data, sample_rate = 100)

    '''

    if window_length == None:
        window_length = sample_rate // 10
