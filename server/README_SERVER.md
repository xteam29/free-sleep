# Server Documentation

## Overview
Express server intended to run on the 8 sleep pod.  

## Developing

### Hot Reloading (on Pod) 
1. SSH into the Pod and run
```
systemctl stop free-sleep
systemctl disable free-sleep
cd /home/dac/free-sleep/server && npm run dev

# When you're done, undo this by CTR+C out of the npm run dev command & run:
systemctl enable free-sleep
systemctl start free-sleep
```
2. Run the front-end app with hot reload and point it to your Pod [app/README_APP.md](../app/README_APP.md#Developing)

### Hot Reloading (on computer, not your Pod)
- `npm run dev:local`


### My development process
1. I run this server on my Pod with hot reloading (see above)
1. I have IntelliJ setup to auto upload my file changes to the Pod [IntelliJ documentation for this config](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tutorial-deployment-in-product.html#downloading).
VSCode also has a similar feature, I think this is the documentation for it [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh)

## Features
- DOES NOT DEPEND ON INTERNET, if your internet goes out, your device will still run
- API capabilities
  - Full control over the temperature
  - Priming the device
  - Scheduling on/off
  - Scheduling temperature changes
  - Alarm scheduling - (work in progress, NOT COMPLETE)

## Architecture
The server is composed of the following key components:

### 1. **Core Server (`server.ts`):**
- Sets up and starts an Express.js server.
- Initializes middleware and routes.
- Manages graceful shutdown processes for reliability.

### 2. **Routes:**
- **`/api/deviceStatus`:** Fetches and updates the status of the device.
- **`/api/settings`:** Manages device settings (e.g., timezone, away mode, priming schedules).
- **`/api/schedules`:** Handles scheduling for device operations.
- **`/api/execute`:** Sends commands directly to the device.
- **`/api/metrics/vitals`:** Biometrics (heart rate, HRV, breathing rate)
- **`/api/metrics/sleep`:** Sleep intervals 

### 3. **Jobs Scheduler (`src/jobs/`):**
- Schedules periodic tasks like temperature adjustments, power on/off, and device priming using the `node-schedule` library.
- Monitors changes to the DB storage files in `src/db/`, clears all schedules and recreates them every time changes are made


### 4. **Database (`src/db/`):**
- The JSON files are created the first time the server runs, you do not need to create them
- Uses `lowdb` for simple JSON-based storage.
- Includes schemas for schedules, settings, and time zones, validated with `zod`.


### 5. **8 Sleep Integration (`src/8sleep/`):**
- Contains utilities to communicate with the "Franken" device using Unix sockets.
  - This is based off of the EXISTING code on the pod in /home/dac/app/

---

## Key Features

### Device control
- The server connects to the device using a Unix socket @ `/deviceinfo/dac.sock` (varies by Pod version & firmware version, path is detected in install.sh script and saved to `/persistent/free-sleep-data/dac_sock_path.txt`)
- Commands are sent to the device for various operations, including temperature adjustments and status retrieval.

### Scheduling
- Jobs like temperature changes, power toggling, and device priming are scheduled based on user-defined schedules.
- Changes to schedules or settings automatically trigger updates to the jobs

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher) - This is not optional, the 8 sleep pod has node v-16.14.2
- NPM or Yarn

### Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
